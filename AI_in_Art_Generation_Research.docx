-- Part 1: EXTENDED DEFINITION OF DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY --
Disruptive Technology; an innovation that significantly alters the way that consumers, industries, or businesses operate. A disruptive technology sweeps away the systems or habits it replaces because it has attributes that are recognizably superior (Smith, 2022).

Breaking it down to its root words, it is a kind of technology that disrupts or causes major changes to the setting. Although the connotation of the word disruptive may sound contrary to the very purpose of innovation, technologies and innovations were made to make changes, it just so happens that the changes some innovations changed the rules of the game. 
All these innovations and technologies are intended to enhance our ways of living by bringing some type of ease in how we would conventionally do certain activities (Kylliäinen, 2019). These innovations and technologies come in different forms, some of the most recent ones we’ve come to know of are the up-and-rising service innovations available online such as the various AI generators (Innolytics, What is Innovation?).

-- Part 2: WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ART GENERATION / HOW DOES IT WORK --

Digital art is continuously growing as our technology evolves quickly, thanks to new inventions and innovations created and discovered in recent times.
One of the most fast-growing and controversial topics is the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically the area of artificial intelligence art or most commonly known as AI art.
According to UNICEF (2021), “AI refers to machine-based systems that can, given a set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions that influence real or virtual environments. 
AI systems interact with us and act on our environment, either directly or indirectly. Often, they appear to operate autonomously, and can adapt their behavior by learning about the context.” 
AI-generated art can include fully autonomous works—in which researchers investigate whether AI can be creative without human intervention—and real-time human-robot collaboration. 
In doing so, they attempt to comprehend human-machine communication. AI is now being fully implemented in various artistic fields, including paintings, poetry, films, and music.


-- Part 3: BRIEF HISTORY AND CURRENT SITUATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ART GENERATION --

There is no single event that led to the development of AI art generators. Instead, the development of AI art generators has been the result of a series of technological and conceptual advancements in the field of artificial intelligence. Below is a brief history of AI-generated art from the 1950s to the present day:

1950s

In the mid-1950s, John McCarthy, also recognized as the Father of Artificial Intelligence (AI), coined AI and defined it as the “science and engineering of making intelligent machines” (Artificial Solutions, 2020). But in addition to making human intelligence the standard for improving AI, human creativity was soon added. AI has then been utilized as a medium for creating art for several years. 

One early example of AI-generated art can be traced back to the 1950s when a computer program called "traveling salesperson" was utilized to generate drawings of abstract shapes and lines to produce simple geometric patterns (Scott, 2022). 

The development of the first artificial neural networks in the 1950s provided a computational model for learning and decision-making inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. But at the time, the technology available for creating and running computer programs was limited, resulting in artworks that were still simple. Nevertheless, these early experiments with AI art established the foundation for more sophisticated AI art generators that would be developed in the following decades. 

1960s to 2000s

The advent of powerful computers in the 1960s allowed researchers to train and evaluate complex artificial neural networks on large datasets.
The ‘60s and ‘70s were the times AI researchers utilized computer programs for creating more complex art, such as drawings of human faces and landscapes. These early AI art generators were restricted by the technology of the time, resulting in art that was often simplistic and lacked subtlety (Anyoha, 2020).
In the 1980s, the introduction of deep learning algorithms enabled artificial neural networks to learn multiple levels of abstraction in data and improve their performance on complex tasks (Yang & Yang, 2014).

During the ‘80s and ‘90s, AI art generators began to evolve, taking advantage of advances in computer hardware and software. These new AI art generators were capable of producing more sophisticated and detailed art, some of which were even exhibited in galleries. A well-known example of AI-generated art in 1999 is the "Electric Sheep screensaver" which employed AI algorithms to generate a sequence of abstract images displayed on computers running the screensaver (Diaz-Aviles, 2019).

Disruptive Technology shakes up the current market and paves the path for innovation. 
It becomes the impetus to the ever-growing market, changing up how the market usually operates by introducing new systems and business models.
A prime example of this are the AI systems.As A.I. becomes more intelligent, sophisticated, and human-like, it is easy to worry and fear the changes it will bring to humanity.
We naturally tend to fear the unknown, as this is supposed to protect us from what is coming, but there are always two sides to the same coin.
On the one hand, art generators are useful for casual users. People who never knew they can make “art”, now can.
That being said, it is fulfilling its intended purpose, which is to help us improve our work, and save money and time.
On the other hand, it poses a great threat, especially in terms of job security to many artists.
Job automation and intellectual property theft are the most pressing concerns. 
Recent events concerning “Lensa, AI” highlighted these points of interest.
Some were fascinated by how well this A.I. works, while many were concerned about the hyper-real images– seen as art and how they can be used incorrectly to deceive people and spread misinformation.
The only way to reduce the risk is to have a regulating body, but we don’t have that right now. 

Another area of concern is whether or not A.I.-generated art is “ real art or not. 
Currently, there’s still no universal definition of what art is, but one thing is certain–art is a product of human creativity, or so it was. 
Again, different points of view came to light. Many opposing ideas, with no one to decide who’s right and wrong. 
Art generators are changing how we process, consume and view art. 

Needless to say, everyone is entitled to their opinion. 
Art generators are disruptive, and their practical and long-term ramifications are yet to be seen. 
Regardless of its negative or positive effects, A.I. Art is now part of our modern, digital world, and as a citizen of this world, it is important to recognize that changes are happening.
We need to be smarter and learn how to take advantage of these tools.
